//Last chance for Gas
//Is there enough gas to drive 200 miles to the next gas station

//First I will list the givens
var gasEfficiency = 25;
//If the MPG of the vehicle's gas efficiency is 25MPG or more
var gasTank = 0.25;
//If the gas tank has 75% or more of gas left
var tankCapacity = 12;
//the tank capacity is a 12 gallon tank
//25 * 12 * 0.67 would give us at least 201 miles

if(gasEfficiency * tankCapacity *gasTank >= 200) 
{
    console.log("Yes, you can make it without stopping for gas!");
}
else
//since 25 * 12 * 0.25 is only 75 it would only get us 75 miles. which means that since 12/0.25 = 3 we only have 3 gallons of gas left
{
    console.log("You only have 3 gallons in your tank, better get gas now while you can!");
}
